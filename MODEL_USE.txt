Quick documentation on model setup, operation, and CSV formats. To be expanded.

This assumes you have installed everything already. If not see README.txt in the installer folder.

Quickie setup and model run:

1. Put the control file (HeatSource_Control.csv) and the executables/scripts in the same directory.
2. Open the control file and parameterize it with your model information. Must be named HeatSource_Control.csv
3. Use HS_Setup to build template files (they will be saved to your input file directory that is specified in the control file).
5. Open the template csv files in excel and input your data. Save it as a csv.
6. Run the model by double clicking on either HS_HydrualicsOnly, HS_SolarOnly, or HS_Temperature. A console should open and you should see the model running.
7. Outputs are saved in the output directory that is specified in the control file.


Quickie formatting for CSV files

1. The heat source control file must be named HeatSource_Control.csv
2. The other csv files can be named whatever you want (they are specified in the control file).
3. Do not change the parameter names in the control file. Only change values in column 3.
4. The date/time column headers must always be be named DateTime
5. The stream kilometer column headers must always be named Stream_KM
6. All the other column header names are user defined (name them whatever you want) as long as the data are in the correct column number (see below).
7. Use the specified unit and unit format identified in the control files and input files. Example mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm is 07/01/2001 16:00
8. In the control file use 999 for a parameter that is not applicable or might be left blank.
9. Tributary and climate data can have multiple files (or just one file). Separate file names and site stream km with commas (see below).

EXAMPLE INPUT FILE:
MyFileName.csv 

Most input file names can be specified in the control file.

ROW
[1] Header Names <- Header name is always the first row. 
[2] Data <- This is the data that must go into row two. Data always starts at the second row (except in the control file).
[N] Data <- This is the data that goes into the last row where the value of [N] is dependent on user specified information in the control file.

COLUMN 
[1] Some Data (some units) <- This is the data that must go into column one. Header name is row 1. Data starts at row 2. 
[2] Some Data (some units) <- This is the data that must go into column two. Header name is row 1. Data starts at row 2. 
[n] Some Data (some units) <- This is the data that must go into some column [n] where [n] is dependent on user specified information in the control file.
[N] Some Data (some units) <- This is the data that must go into the last column where the value of [N] is dependent on user specified information in the control file.

Delimiters are commas.
If there is a comma in your text string bracket the string with quotes like this "This is my string, it has a comma".

###############################################################################
CONTROL FILE
HeatSource_Control.csv 

The control file name must not change.

ROW
[1] See below
[n] See below
[39] See below

COLUMN  
[1] Parameter Number (for user reference - technically not used by the model)
[2] Parameter Name (Do not change)
[3] Parameter Input Value (user specified)

Note: Inflow and climate data can have multiple files (or just one). Multiple inputs for the same column are put in quotes and separated by commas.
For example if you have two inflow sites (trib one flows in at km 5.45 and trib two at km 0.30), it might look like this in the control file:
If you build the control file in excel, and save it as a csv file the quotes will automatically be included.

Row | Column -> [1] [2]				                      [3]
[16]		        16, # TRIBUTARY SITES, 		          2
[15]		        17, # TRIBUTARY INPUT FILE NAMES, 	"Inflow_01.csv, Inflow_02.csv" 
[18]		        18, # TRIBUTARY MODEL KM, 		"4.05, 3.35"

or alternatively,

Row | Column -> [1] [2]				                      [3]
[16]		        16, # TRIBUTARY SITES, 		          2
[15]		        17, # TRIBUTARY INPUT FILE NAMES, 	Inflows_all.csv
[18]		        18, # TRIBUTARY MODEL KM, 		"4.05, 3.35"


Below are all the input parameters that must be included in the control file.
Technically the parameters can be in any row as long as the names in column 2 don't change and the parameter values are in column 3 (parameters values not shown here).
If "USE HEAT SOURCE 8 LANDCOVER METHODS" is TRUE, the model will revert back to heat source 8 methods for landcover sampling methods.
If FALSE, the direction for each the radial samples (n) measured in degrees from 0 (0 = north) will correspond to (total radial samples / 360) x radial sample n. 
In addition the first landcover sample in each direction will be at the stream node.
